# tic-tac-toe-reinforcement-learning

This project implements a reinforcement learning solution for Tic-Tac-Toe using Q-learning.

## Overview
An AI agent is trained through self-play and interaction with a custom game environment.  
The agent learns an optimal policy by balancing exploration and exploitation and is evaluated
against both random and perfect strategies.

## Technologies
- Python
- Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy / Matplotlib
